## Certifications

Certifications are important to career progression in the IT and SecOps industries. Adding them to your resume may qualify you for a broader range of job opportunities and signal competency to future employers. Be aware, however, that each certification will require a substantial financial and study time commitment.

### CompTIA

CompTIA is a vendor-neutral certification body know for its entry-level certifications.

- CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)
  - Consider ITF+ if you lack basic computer operations skills and are curious if an operations career is right for you. Non-technical folks should start here.
  
- CompTIA A+
  - If you've never worked in IT operations, this will give you the fundamentals of service desk operations and endpoint support.
  
- CompTIA Network+
  - This one builds your knowledge of OSI layers and IP stack protocols. If you're completely new to tech, you may find this one difficult. Be sure to follow a study plan for this one.
  
- CompTIA Security+
  - Popular entry level cyber security certification required by DoD job listings. Be sure to follow a study plan for this one.
