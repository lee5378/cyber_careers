<p>As with any profession, a successful career in cybersecurity is an accumulation of education, training, and real-world experience. Formulating an actionable career strategy and getting started in this diverse, technical profession can be daunting, and we are here to help.</p>

<h2>Why work in Cybersecurity?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cybersecurity is one of the most exciting technological career fields right now. At the very cutting edge of both technology and risk management, today’s cyber professionals are more critical than ever to the success of many products, projects, and organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why is it so relevant now?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In prior decades, businesses would commonly relegate computer security duties to IT; however, as businesses evolve to adapt to modern computer risks, we now see cybersecurity increasingly becoming embedded into the very core of business strategy, with principle cybersecurity leaders in an organization reporting to the CEO, board, or even serving as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the rapid adoption of technology, organizations are encountering new security risks more than ever before. As businesses adopt more mature risk management, security compliance, and defensive processes into their overall strategy, the need for cybersecurity talent continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Is cybersecurity the right career for me?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before we explore how to transition into cybersecurity as a career, it is important to ask yourself, “Is this field a good fit for me?” Many cybersecurity professionals transition into the field from adjoining disciplines such as IT networking or software development. However, for a newcomer to a technology-based profession, determining whether a career in cybersecurity is a good fit can be challenging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One way to get an idea of this profession is to ask someone you know about what their day to day duties are like. Internet research about careers in this field may also give you a better idea of what skills are used. Another approach is to try out some basic cybersecurity tasks firsthand to get a feel for whether this line of work clicks with you. At Code Fellows, our Ops 101 course is designed to do just that – allow you to get a taste of the cybersecurity profession in a single-day hands-on workshop.</p>

<h2>How do I get into cybersecurity?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with any profession, a successful career in cybersecurity is an accumulation of education, training, and real-world experience. However, cybersecurity is a broad and diverse discipline ranging from business roles to the most technical engineering roles. Formulating an actionable career strategy and getting started in this diverse, technical profession can be daunting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Training either directly in cybersecurity or an adjoining discipline such as computer science will provide a strong academic foundation for you to build up your overall career, though this should only be one aspect of an overall career strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another important aspect of a successful cybersecurity career is continuous skill development; training in cybersecurity usually involves earning a certification that is appropriate to your level of experience in the field, of which there is an abundance in this profession. The sheer number of cybersecurity certifications can be intimidating, and many intermediate and senior certification bodies will require a minimum number of years of full-time experience before you may qualify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final and perhaps most important aspect of a successful cybersecurity career strategy is the acquisition of real-world experience.</p>
