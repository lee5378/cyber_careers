*   [DEF CON Hacking Conference][45]
    
    > Originally started in 1993, it was a meant to be a party for member of "Platinum Net", a Fido protocol based hacking network out of Canada. As the main U.S. hub I was helping the Platinum Net organizer (I forget his name) plan a closing party for all the member BBS systems and their users. He was going to shut down the network when his dad took a new job and had to move away. We talking about where we might hold it, when all of a sudden he left early and disappeared. I was just planning a party for a network that was shut down, except for my U.S. nodes. I decided what the hell, I'll invite the members of all the other networks my BBS (A Dark Tangent System) system was a part of including Cyber Crime International (CCI), Hit Net, Tired of Protection (ToP), and like 8 others I can't remember. Why not invite everyone on #hack? Good idea!

*   [RSA Conference][46]
    
    > For almost 30 years, RSA Conference has been a driving force behind the world’s cybersecurity agenda. The central point where people from around the world gather to share, learn and grow. And the place that provides a forum for innovation and partnership. It’s even more important today to have these points of connection, as cybersecurity has become more relevant across all aspects of our daily lives. Our commitment is to connect you to the most knowledgeable people and cutting-edge content that will empower you to stay ahead of cyberthreats and advance your career. The conversations and debates are not the perspective of RSA Conference but designed for open and honest dialog that often provide different/unique and sometimes opposing views in order to get to the heart of the problem and ultimately a creative/unbiased solution.
