            <h2><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Cyber-Security-for-Control-Systems/events/275433594/">(CS)2AI ONLINE- Mission Kill: Process Targeting in ICS Attacks, with Joe Slowik</a></h2>      
            <h3>Thursday, January 14, 2021 from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM PST</h3>       
            <h3>Typical conceptions of ICS targeting focus on direct disruption of organizations through a single, specific action resulting in complete operational loss: opening breakers to interrupt the flow of electricity, or tripping a safety system to shut down a plant. Yet further analysis of ICS events over time indicates adversaries are pursuing far more interesting - and ambitious - attack patterns in industrial environments.</h3>

            <h2><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Cyber-Security-for-Control-Systems/events/275433594/">Seattle OpenSource Linux Monthly Meetup</a></h2>      
            <h3>Monday, January 18, 2021 from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM PST</h3>       
            <h3>The Seattle OpenSource Linux Meetup is a fairly informal group of friendly Linux enthusiasts that gather to discuss a broad range of topics surrounding Linux and the open source universe. This is a great place to come and talk about your fav open source project, possibly get an answer to that question regarding some bash command that is giving you trouble or to come get some guidance as to where to start your own open source journey. Sometimes members will give talks about tools or projects they are excited about, it's definitely not unusual for members to cluster around a laptop to help solve another members software issues and the conversation is always lively.</h3>

            <h2><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Cyber-Security-for-Control-Systems/events/275433594/">TAG Cybersecurity: January 2021 "Security Tools Pot Luck"</a></h2>        
            <h3>Tuesday, January 19, 2021 from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM PST</h3>      
            <h3>Join TAG Cybersecurity on January 19 @ 7 pm for our monthly meeting.
    

For January’s TAG Cybersecurity, we are having a Pot Luck. Not a food Pot Luck, but a content Pot Luck. Everybody brings a 3-5 minute story on a single (broad) topic. The story can be about your experience, something interesting you’ve read about it, or the like. It can be a story of success, or failure (failure is always the best). It can be about something traditional and well-understood, or cutting-edge.

<a href="https://defcon.org/" rel="nofollow">DEF CON Hacking Conference</a>

Originally started in 1993, it was a meant to be a party for member of "Platinum Net", a Fido protocol based hacking network out of Canada. As the main U.S. hub I was helping the Platinum Net organizer (I forget his name) plan a closing party for all the member BBS systems and their users. He was going to shut down the network when his dad took a new job and had to move away. We talking about where we might hold it, when all of a sudden he left early and disappeared. I was just planning a party for a network that was shut down, except for my U.S. nodes. I decided what the hell, I'll invite the members of all the other networks my BBS (A Dark Tangent System) system was a part of including Cyber Crime International (CCI), Hit Net, Tired of Protection (ToP), and like 8 others I can't remember. Why not invite everyone on #hack? Good idea!
